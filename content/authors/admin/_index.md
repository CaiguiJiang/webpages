I am a research scientist at Visual Computing Center (VCC) of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). Before that, I worked as a research scientist and Postdoc at ICSI, an institute affiliated with UC Berkeley and the Max Planck Institute for Informatics from Jun. 2016 to Jan. 2019. I obtained my Ph.D. from KAUST under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Helmut Pottmann and Prof. Dr. Peter Wonka. I received my B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xi’an Jiaotong University (XJTU) in 2008 and 2011 respectively. My research interests are in geometric modeling, geometry processing, architectural geometry, computer graphics, and computer vision.
